;; The kind of audience we have in mind is of general Clojure programmers. Some talks will also be useful and interesting for people who are new to Clojure as well.

;; ## Goals

;; * Build new open collaborations around key Clojure growth priorities.
;; * Create a welcoming environment for newcomers to get involved.
;; * Strengthen community support by connecting practitioners.
;; * Talk Driven Development - use the conferences as a clear target date for projects to reach sharing milestones.
;; * Build on lessons learned from [SciNoj Light](https://scicloj.github.io/scinoj-light-1/).
;; * Follow our conference-making approach that we üé• [recently discussed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6ICeRyXHsI).

;; ## Chat

;; All communication of the conference will take place at the [Clojurians Zulip chat](https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/chat/). A dedicated channel will be created soon.
