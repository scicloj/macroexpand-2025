;; ## Speakers
;; 
;; At the Macroexpand conferences, we focus on talks and projects that help Clojure grow.
;; 
;; Our guidelines, based on experience, ensure your work on the talk will be meaningful and fruitful. All talks should cover active projects, ranging from short-term experiments to long-term reports, from analyses to documentation or library improvements. A good talk combines good storytelling with actual progress on your projects.
;; 
;; Note these guidelines may differ from typical tech conference requirements. If you have any questions, ideas, or requests, please reach out to discuss and find the best approach.
;; 
;; ### Guidelines
;; 
;; - Contact us early with project ideas - we can help shape them and suggest new ones.
;; - All talks must include clear notes and reproducible code, hosted on [Clojure Civitas](https://clojurecivitas.github.io/) or [Clojure Data Tutorials](https://scicloj.github.io/clojure-data-tutorials/).
;; - We recommend Timothy Prately's 🎥 [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lceazLPcSZg) to Clojure Civitas as a way to get started.
;; - If these hosting options do not work for you, let us discuss alternatives.
;; - It is highly preferred to create notes which are fully reproducible, including all the data and clear usage instructions.
;; - The kind of audience you should have in mind is of general Clojure programmers. We do recommend making your talk useful and interesting for people who are new to Clojure as well.
;; - Talk *proposals* should also contain self-contained notes hosted at these spaces and serving as a meaningful proof-of-concept.
;; - Each of the two conferences, [Macroexpand-Noj](./macroexpand-noj.html) & [Macroexpand-Deep](./macroexpand-deep.html), has a list of preferred topics, that will be prioritized.
;; - Team presentations are welcome.
;; - We encourage collaboration with friends from other fields, including non-programmers.
;; - If you want to create a project for the conference but prefer not to be the one presenting it, you can collaborate with others who will present on your behalf.
;; - We may help you team up with co-presenters.
;; - We are here to help - reach out to brainstorm ideas or find collaborators.
