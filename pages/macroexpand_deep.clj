;; ## Macroexpand-Deep - the first Clojure AI conference
;; 
;; **ðŸ“… October 24-25, 2025 | Online Conference**
;;
;; The Macroexpand-Deep conference focuses on the development of research and practical applications around AI systems in Clojure. As the first dedicated Clojure AI conference, we're bringing together pioneers exploring how Clojure's unique strengths can advance AI development. This conference is one of the [Macroexpand 2025](./) pair of conferences organized by [Scicloj](https://scicloj.github.io/).
;;
;; ### About the Conference
;;
;; This two-day online event explores AI systems broadly - from large language models and neural networks to symbolic AI and hybrid approaches. By 'AI systems', we typically mean compositions of deep networks with other components, but we welcome alternative interpretations and novel approaches that leverage Clojure's functional paradigm.
;;
;; Whether you're building production AI applications, conducting research, or exploring the intersection of functional programming and machine learning, this conference provides a platform to share your work and learn from others pushing the boundaries.
;;
;; ### Call for Proposals
;; 
;; **Submission Deadline: September 8, 2025**
;;
;; We invite pioneering work at the intersection of Clojure and AI. All talks must include reproducible code and clear documentation.
;;
;; [Submit Your Talk Proposal](https://forms.gle/rQj5cR1FPAYR7mA97){class="btn btn-gradient" target="_blank"}
;;
;; Please review our [speaker guidelines](./speakers.html) for detailed requirements and recommendations.
;;
;; ### Preferred Topics
;; 
;; The following areas will be prioritized in talk proposals:
;; 
;; * **Tutorial Talks** (Highly Prioritized) - Beginner-friendly, step-by-step guides to AI concepts, LLM integration, neural network basics, and getting started with Clojure AI tools
;; * **LLMs & Embeddings** - Building applications with language models, RAG systems, prompt engineering, and vector databases
;; * **Algorithm Evaluation** - Evaluating AI algorithms in specific domains, benchmarking, and comparative studies
;; * **Neural Network Architectures** - Creating, training, and deploying neural networks using Clojure-based tools
;; * **Interpretability** - Understanding trained models, mechanistic interpretability, and explainable AI
;; * **Hybrid Systems** - Combining symbolic and neural approaches, reasoning systems, and knowledge graphs
;; * **Tools & Libraries** - New frameworks, improvements to existing tools, and interop with Python/Java AI ecosystems
;; * **Production AI** - Deployment strategies, monitoring, and scaling AI systems built with Clojure
;; * **Research & Theory** - Novel approaches, theoretical foundations, and experimental work
;; * **AI, Ethics, and social implications**
;;
;; ### Why Clojure for AI?
;;
;; Clojure offers unique advantages for AI development: immutable data structures for reproducible experiments, REPL-driven development for rapid prototyping, seamless Java/Python interop for leveraging existing AI libraries, and functional composition for building complex AI pipelines. This conference celebrates and advances these strengths.
;;
;; ### Target Audience
;;
;; Clojure programmers interested in AI, from those taking first steps with machine learning to researchers developing novel approaches. We also welcome AI practitioners from other languages curious about Clojure's potential in this space.
;;
;; ### Connect & Discuss
;;
;; Join the conversation at the [Clojurians Zulip chat](https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/chat/) where we discuss AI projects and help each other explore this exciting frontier.
