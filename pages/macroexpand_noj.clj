;; ## Macroexpand-Noj - growing the Noj ecosystem
;; 
;; **ðŸ“… October 17-18, 2025 | Online Conference**
;;
;; The Macroexpand-Noj conference is focused on the growth of the [Noj](https://scicloj.github.io/noj) toolkit for data science. Noj is a Clojure toolkit that brings together data processing, visualization, and scientific computing libraries into a cohesive whole. This conference is one of the [Macroexpand 2025](./) pair of conferences organized by [Scicloj](https://scicloj.github.io/).
;; 
;; ### About the Conference
;;
;; This two-day online event brings together practitioners, library authors, and data enthusiasts to share knowledge, showcase projects, and collaborate on growing Clojure's data science capabilities. Whether you're analyzing real-world datasets, building new tools, or documenting existing libraries, this conference is for you.
;;
;; ### Call for Proposals
;; 
;; **Submission Deadline: September 8, 2025**
;;
;; We invite you to share your work with the Noj ecosystem and broader data science community. All talks must include reproducible code and clear documentation.
;;
;; [Submit Your Talk Proposal](https://forms.gle/rQj5cR1FPAYR7mA97){class="btn btn-gradient" target="_blank"}
;;
;; Please review our [speaker guidelines](./speakers.html) for detailed requirements and recommendations.
;;
;; ### Preferred Topics
;; 
;; The following will be prioritized in talk proposals:
;; 
;; * **Documentation** - Making libraries, theory, and methods accessible to the community
;; * **Real-world Analysis** - Practical data science examples and case studies (including follow-ups from [SciNoj Light](https://scicloj.github.io/scinoj-light-1/))
;; * **Tools & Libraries** - New features, integrations, and ecosystem improvements
;; * **Data Engineering** - Processing pipelines, ETL, and data infrastructure
;; * **Visualization** - Interactive graphics, dashboards, and visual analytics
;; * **Scientific Computing** - Numerical methods, statistics, and domain-specific applications
;; * **Machine Learning** - Models, workflows, and ML engineering with Clojure
;;
;; ### Target Audience
;;
;; General Clojure programmers interested in data science, from beginners exploring data tools to experienced practitioners sharing advanced techniques. Talks should be accessible while providing depth and practical value.
;;
;; ### Connect & Discuss
;;
;; Join the conversation at the [Clojurians Zulip chat](https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/chat/) where we coordinate projects and help each other with data science in Clojure.
