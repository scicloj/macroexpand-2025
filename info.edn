This case study demonstrates how even data science beginners can implement correlation analysis and the Apriori algorithm using Clojure tools. I'll walk through my learning process with [Tablecloth](https://scicloj.github.io/tablecloth/) for data manipulation and [Kindly](https://scicloj.github.io/kindly/) for visualizations, focusing on practical solutions rather than theoretical complexity. Join me to see how entry-level Scicloj implementations can transform customer order histories into meaningful cross-selling recommendations, proving that useful data insights are accessible without deep expertise."

   :abstract "In the field of AI, Python is the current reigning champ. But the Python ecosystem's dirty secret is that most of the libraries holding the system together are wrappers around C/C++ libraries that do most of the important work. 
[Jank](https://github.com/jank-lang/jank) is the native Clojure dialect built on compiler technologies like LLVM, giving it access into the same native libraries powering the Python ecosystem. As Jank heads towards its first alpha release, its most highly anticipated feature, seamless C++ interop is already capable of wrapping and using native C++ libraries for machine learning and artificial intelligence. In this talk, we will show how to leverage Jank's C++ interop to wrap the most popular deep learning library in usage right now, [libtorch](https://pytorch.org/cppdocs/), which most would have known through its Python frontend, [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).
As a proof of concept, we will display an implementation of GPT-2, the LLM released in 2019 using our Torch wrapper.
This talk will give Clojure practitioners interested in using Clojure for ML/AI a glimpse into the future of how important C++ libraries can be utilized with Jank."

   :bio "Bruce Hauman is a prolific toolmaker and long-time contributor to the Clojure community, perhaps best known as the creator of Figwheel—the build tool that introduced live code reloading and made real-time browser development a reality for ClojureScript developers. Bruce’s legendary 2014 “Flappy Bird” demo not only turned heads, but set a new standard for interactive coding, enabling developers to see their changes instantly and stay in the creative flow.
Bruce also built Devcards, a library for interactive documentation that brings a visual REPL experience to ClojureScript, and Rebel Readline, the feature-rich REPL for Clojure and ClojureScript, complete with syntax highlighting, code completion, and inline documentation.
Bruce’s latest project, Clojure MCP, tackles the next frontier: enabling AI assistants to work Clojure projects by connecting directly to live REPLs, providing real-time feedback and validation to improve the quality of AI-generated Clojure code.
Beyond his tool building chops, Bruce is guided by a profound respect for users and a conviction that developer tooling should be radically better—simple, powerful, and joyful to use. He’s also a fan of the outdoors: an avid canoe tripper, Appalachian Trail thru-hiker, and, currently, the hands-on renovator of a former church-turned-home in Saskatchewan."

Tomáš graduated in Mathematical Informatics from Masaryk University in 1996, and after decades in publishing, returned to coding in 2022—working almost exclusively in Clojure. His background bridges technical and literary worlds, allowing him to approach basket analysis from both perspectives: as a publisher seeking business insights and as a programmer exploring Scicloj's capabilities.
In 2021, he co-founded Servantes, developing software for modern publishers worldwide. This presentation reflects his recent journey, having attended machine learning classes at his alma mater last year, and represents his practical experiments applying these concepts to his publishing business with Clojure tools.
He lives in the Czech Republic, in city of Brno."
