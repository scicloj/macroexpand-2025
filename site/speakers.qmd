## Speakers

At the Macroexpand conferences, we focused on talks and projects that help Clojure grow.

Our guidelines, based on experience, ensured that work on each talk was meaningful and fruitful. All talks covered active projects, ranging from short-term experiments to long-term reports, from analyses to documentation or library improvements. Good talks combined storytelling with actual progress on projects.


### Speaker Guidelines

The conferences followed these guidelines:

- Speakers worked with organizers early to shape project ideas
- All talks included clear notes and reproducible code, hosted on [Clojure Civitas](https://clojurecivitas.github.io/) or [Clojure Data Tutorials](https://scicloj.github.io/clojure-data-tutorials/)
- Notes were fully reproducible, including all data and clear usage instructions
- Talks were designed for general Clojure programmers, with accessibility for newcomers
- Each conference ([Macroexpand-Noj](./macroexpand_noj.html) & [Macroexpand-Deep](./macroexpand_deep.html)) had a list of preferred topics that were prioritized
- Team presentations and cross-field collaborations were encouraged
