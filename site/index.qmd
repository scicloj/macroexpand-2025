# Macroexpand 2025

Macroexpand 2025 is a pair of online Clojure conferences organised by [Scicloj](https://scicloj.github.io/). They will focus on two high-priority topics on our journey to make Clojure grow to new fields: **Noj** and **AI**.

These conferences are related and informed by the [Macroexpand Gatherings](https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/macroexpand/) series, that focuses on in-depth discussions around Clojure growth.

Please see the [Speakers](./speakers.html) chapter for guidelines.

## Target Audience
The kind of audience we have in mind is of general Clojure programmers. Some talks will also be useful and interesting for people who are new to Clojure as well.

## Goals
* Build new open collaborations around key Clojure growth priorities.
* Create a welcoming environment for newcomers to get involved.
* Strengthen community support by connecting practitioners.
* Talk Driven Development - use the conferences as a clear target date for projects to reach sharing milestones.
* Build on lessons learned from [SciNoj Light](https://scicloj.github.io/scinoj-light-1/).
* Follow our our conference-making approach that we 🎥 [recently discussed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6ICeRyXHsI).

## Chat
All communication of the conference will take place at the [Clojurians Zulip chat](https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/chat/). A dedicated channel will be created soon.
