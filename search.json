The root cause is often not technical incompetence, but rather an over-optimistic faith in LLM capabilities without accounting for their fundamental limitations. Just as an engineer hanging a heavy shelf wouldn't rely solely on manufacturer specifications without safety margins, building reliable LLM systems requires a \"Murphy's Law\" mindset that anticipates failure modes. Through our experience building StartCheck, a production document analysis platform, we've learned that true reliability comes from understanding and designing around core LLM limitations: input quality sensitivity, task complexity degradation, reasoning constraints, output length trade-offs, hallucinations, and consistency challenges.\n\n\n\nSpeaker\n\n\n\nSiavash Mohammady\nSiavash is a Clojure developer with a knack for trying new things and crafting solutions through creative combinations of technology.

But the Python ecosystem's dirty secret is that most of the libraries holding the system together are wrappers around C/C++ libraries that do most of the important work. Jank is the native Clojure dialect built on compiler technologies like LLVM, giving it access into the same native libraries powering the Python ecosystem. As Jank heads towards its first alpha release, its most highly anticipated feature, seamless C++ interop is already capable of wrapping and using native C++ libraries for machine learning and artificial intelligence. In this talk, we will show how to leverage Jank's C++ interop to wrap the most popular deep learning library in usage right now, libtorch, which most would have known through its Python frontend, PyTorch. As a proof of concept, we will display an implementation of GPT-2, the LLM released in 2019 using our Torch wrapper. This talk will give Clojure practitioners interested in using Clojure for ML/AI a glimpse into the future of how important C++ libraries can be utilized with Jank.\n\n\n\nSpeakers\n\n\n\nMonty Bichouna\nMonty is an aspiring compiler engineer who enjoys Lisps and always wanted a reason to learn Clojure.

Finally I will give you some of my best practices and summarize with the lessons learned.SpeakerLudger SolbachLudger Solbach is a software architect for 'msg for automotive' in Germany.\nHe is the creator of Overarch, a lightweight system modeling and visualization tool\nand QClojure, a library for programming quantum computers.\nHis favorite programming language by far is Clojure, a modern functional LISP.\nHe uses it for his open source work, at work when feasible, and to create\nmodels for his 3D-Printer.14:00 - 16:00Panel: AI assistantsAbstractWe will have a conversation with a few of the toolmakers behind Clojure's main AI assistants.SpeakersEric DalloEric Dallo is a Emacs, NixOS fanatic, he loves programming, especially when focused on dev tooling, He maintains clojure-lsp, ECA, deps-bin, lsp-mode, and other related libraries, Eric works with Clojure at Nubank and currently is focused on AI pair programming multi-editors with ECA.Peter StrombergPeter Str√∂mberg is a curious coder since 40+ years and is extra fascinated by making software that he uses do new things. These days he practically lives in VS Code and is making Clojure related extensions for it. Peter maintains Calva, Joyride, and Calva Backseat Driver. Backseat Driver is an AI extension for VS Code Copilot, giving the AI tools for using the Clojure REPL, as well as for structural editing.Bruce HaumanBruce Hauman is a prolific toolmaker and long-time contributor to the Clojure community, perhaps best known as the creator of Figwheel‚Äîthe build tool that introduced live code reloading and made real-time browser development a reality for ClojureScript developers. Bruce‚Äôs legendary 2014 ‚ÄúFlappy Bird‚Äù demo not only turned heads, but set a new standard for interactive coding, enabling developers to see their changes instantly and stay in the creative flow.\nBruce also built Devcards, a library for interactive documentation that brings a visual REPL experience to ClojureScript, and Rebel Readline, the feature-rich REPL for Clojure and ClojureScript, complete with syntax highlighting, code completion, and inline documentation.\nBruce‚Äôs latest project, Clojure MCP, tackles the next frontier: enabling AI assistants to work Clojure projects by connecting directly to live REPLs, providing real-time feedback and validation to improve the quality of AI-generated Clojure code.\nBeyond his tool building chops, Bruce is guided by a profound respect for users and a conviction that developer tooling should be radically better‚Äîsimple, powerful, and joyful to use. He‚Äôs also a fan of the outdoors: an avid canoe tripper, Appalachian Trail thru-hiker, and, currently, the hands-on renovator of a former church-turned-home in Saskatchewan.16:00Architecting reliability in LLM systemsAbstractLarge Language Models have captured the imagination of developers worldwide, yet many LLM-powered systems fail in production despite impressive demos. The root cause is often not technical incompetence, but rather an over-optimistic faith in LLM capabilities without accounting for their fundamental limitations. Just as an engineer hanging a heavy shelf wouldn't rely solely on manufacturer specifications without safety margins, building reliable LLM systems requires a \"Murphy's Law\" mindset that anticipates failure modes. Through our experience building StartCheck, a production document analysis platform, we've learned that true reliability comes from understanding and designing around core LLM limitations: input quality sensitivity, task complexity degradation, reasoning constraints, output length trade-offs, hallucinations, and consistency challenges.SpeakerSiavash MohammadySiavash is a Clojure developer with a knack for trying new things and crafting solutions through creative combinations of technology. He's worked on GIS software for agriculture, building a low-code BI tool powered by Clojure, LLMs, and rule engines to extract key reports for executives. These days, he's working on startcheck.xyz, an automatic pitch deck evaluation software.17:00Open PracticeAbstractWe will spend some time together practicing the tools, methods, and ideas we have seen at other talks.18:00Experimenting with LLM Subliminal Learning in ClojureAbstractI read the paper \"Subliminal Learning: Language models transmit behavioral traits via hidden signals in data\" and wanted to explore these concepts myself. In this talk I replicate some of the results from the paper interactively in a live coding demo. Specifically, we will look at running multiple interdependent batch processing jobs from a Clojure REPL.SpeakerJustin TirrellI'm Justin, I'm a Clojure maximalist and independent software developer. I like working on trading systems and GUIs and rolling my own software tools and yak shaving.19:0020:00Saturday, October 2509:00Opening & WelcomeAbstractWe will just spend some time together and discuss what is coming for the day.10:00 - 12:00Bridging Worlds: Building Graph Neural Networks with Clojure and Python Interoperability (+ Practice)AbstractDiscover how to build Graph Neural Networks by combining Clojure's functional elegance with Python's ML ecosystem. This talk demonstrates practical interoperability using libpython-clj to call PyTorch Geometric from Clojure, creating powerful GNN solutions while maintaining REPL-driven development workflows. We'll live-code a complete Graph Convolutional Network, from data ingestion to visualization, showing how Clojure's immutability and Python's deep learning capabilities create a useful combination for modern AI development. After the talk and discussion, we will practice some things in the REPL together: using PyTorch from Clojure, and maybe more.SpeakerJelena LosicI am Jelena, functional programming developer with 10 years of industry experience and mathematical educational background. I am curious about the networks and laws that are applicable in large scales, leading to better understanding of big data.12:00Open PracticeAbstractWe will spend some time together practicing the tools, methods, and ideas we have seen at other talks.13:00Building Dynamic Entity Extraction with BosquetAbstractEvery text processing application needs to answer a question: what is this text about? Named entity extraction is one part of the answer to this. It identifies and links words to real-world entities‚Äîturning \"Macroexpand 2025\" into structured data about a specific technology conference happening in a specific year.This extraction process involves multiple steps that can be implemented using LLMs. This presentation demonstrates how Bosquet, an LLM orchestration library, can help with building entity extraction pipelines.Speaker≈Ωygimantas MedelisAuthor of Bosquet, Clojure user since its v1.0. I have been working with unstructured text data processing for over a decade - hence the topic of the talk.14:00 - 16:00Panel: broader implications of AIAbstractWe will discuss the broader implications of the AI rush, a few of the ways it affects our lives, and what we might be able to do about it.SpeakersKira HoweKira's been writing software for the past decade with a focus on data-intensive web apps and a particular interest in Clojure programming and data visualization. She loves open source development, fostering communities online and in-person, and learning new things. When she's not at her desk, you can find Kira teaching yoga, playing violin, or running with her dog.Ray McDermottRay has decades of experience writing commercial software for databases, finance, manufacturing and cloud services. He is a Clojure enthusiast and advocate and produces and participates in several podcasts and YouTube channels. The impact of hyper-scaled LLMs is the subject of his most recent project. While not raging, he‚Äôs gardening, out on a bike or in the woods with a camera.Josh GloverJosh is a software engineer, engineering leader, podcast host, and union organiser hailing from Stockholm. A technology enthusiast from early in life, he has been becoming increasingly aware of the social impacts of technology.

He has been building voice AI agents for the last 1.5 years for enterprise clients and is the creator of simulflow - a voice AI agent clojure framework.17:00Building Event Sourced Agentic Applications with GrainAbstractLearn how ObneyAI uses its open source Clojure framework called Grain to build Event Sourced applications with first-class agentic workflows that blend the best of the Clojure and Python ecosystems.SpeakerCameron BarreCameron Barre has been a professional Clojure developer since 2016 and is currently CTO at a small consultancy in the AI engineering space called ObneyAI.18:00Lightning TalksAbstractVarious short talks by conference participants19:00Jank & Torch: Native Deep Learning in ClojureAbstractIn the field of AI, Python is the current reigning champ. But the Python ecosystem's dirty secret is that most of the libraries holding the system together are wrappers around C/C++ libraries that do most of the important work. Jank is the native Clojure dialect built on compiler technologies like LLVM, giving it access into the same native libraries powering the Python ecosystem. As Jank heads towards its first alpha release, its most highly anticipated feature, seamless C++ interop is already capable of wrapping and using native C++ libraries for machine learning and artificial intelligence. In this talk, we will show how to leverage Jank's C++ interop to wrap the most popular deep learning library in usage right now, libtorch, which most would have known through its Python frontend, PyTorch. As a proof of concept, we will display an implementation of GPT-2, the LLM released in 2019 using our Torch wrapper. This talk will give Clojure practitioners interested in using Clojure for ML/AI a glimpse into the future of how important C++ libraries can be utilized with Jank.SpeakersMonty BichounaMonty is an aspiring compiler engineer who enjoys Lisps and always wanted a reason to learn Clojure. He found an excellent reason with jank, the native Clojure dialect.Shantanu SardesaiShantanu is a budding Clojure programmer and the newest member of the jank mentees team. With a background in mainstream languages like Kotlin and TypeScript, and a longstanding fascination with Clojure, compilers, and runtimes, he was naturally drawn to jank.Jianling ZhongJianling is a software engineer with a focus on machine learning. He has always been intrigued by how compilers work. He has been hacking on jank, even though he had little experience with Clojure! The work of bringing torch to jank is right up his alley.20:00ConclusionAbstractWe will spend some time together with closing thoughts.\nDetecting your timezone...* Schedule is subject to change.

This talk will go over all of the pieces involved in voice ai from best models to use, turn detection, context management to scripting and instruction following to hosting and scaling. By the end you will better understand what it takes to build highly reliable voice AI agents with ClojureSpeakerStoica OvidiuOvidiu Stoica is a software developer with 10 years of experience, out of which the last 5 are in Clojure. He has been building voice AI agents for the last 1.5 years for enterprise clients and is the creator of simulflow - a voice AI agent clojure framework.\nArchitecting reliability in LLM systemsAbstractLarge Language Models have captured the imagination of developers worldwide, yet many LLM-powered systems fail in production despite impressive demos. The root cause is often not technical incompetence, but rather an over-optimistic faith in LLM capabilities without accounting for their fundamental limitations. Just as an engineer hanging a heavy shelf wouldn't rely solely on manufacturer specifications without safety margins, building reliable LLM systems requires a \"Murphy's Law\" mindset that anticipates failure modes. Through our experience building StartCheck, a production document analysis platform, we've learned that true reliability comes from understanding and designing around core LLM limitations: input quality sensitivity, task complexity degradation, reasoning constraints, output length trade-offs, hallucinations, and consistency challenges.SpeakerSiavash MohammadySiavash is a Clojure developer with a knack for trying new things and crafting solutions through creative combinations of technology.

But the Python ecosystem's dirty secret is that most of the libraries holding the system together are wrappers around C/C++ libraries that do most of the important work. Jank is the native Clojure dialect built on compiler technologies like LLVM, giving it access into the same native libraries powering the Python ecosystem. As Jank heads towards its first alpha release, its most highly anticipated feature, seamless C++ interop is already capable of wrapping and using native C++ libraries for machine learning and artificial intelligence. In this talk, we will show how to leverage Jank's C++ interop to wrap the most popular deep learning library in usage right now, libtorch, which most would have known through its Python frontend, PyTorch. As a proof of concept, we will display an implementation of GPT-2, the LLM released in 2019 using our Torch wrapper. This talk will give Clojure practitioners interested in using Clojure for ML/AI a glimpse into the future of how important C++ libraries can be utilized with Jank.SpeakersMonty BichounaMonty is an aspiring compiler engineer who enjoys Lisps and always wanted a reason to learn Clojure. He found an excellent reason with jank, the native Clojure dialect.Shantanu SardesaiShantanu is a budding Clojure programmer and the newest member of the jank mentees team. With a background in mainstream languages like Kotlin and TypeScript, and a longstanding fascination with Clojure, compilers, and runtimes, he was naturally drawn to jank.Jianling ZhongJianling is a software engineer with a focus on machine learning. He has always been intrigued by how compilers work. He has been hacking on jank, even though he had little experience with Clojure! The work of bringing torch to jank is right up his alley.\nPanel: AI assistantsAbstractWe will have a conversation with a few of the toolmakers behind Clojure's main AI assistants.SpeakersEric DalloEric Dallo is a Emacs, NixOS fanatic, he loves programming, especially when focused on dev tooling, He maintains clojure-lsp, ECA, deps-bin, lsp-mode, and other related libraries, Eric works with Clojure at Nubank and currently is focused on AI pair programming multi-editors with ECA.Peter StrombergPeter Str√∂mberg is a curious coder since 40+ years and is extra fascinated by making software that he uses do new things. These days he practically lives in VS Code and is making Clojure related extensions for it. Peter maintains Calva, Joyride, and Calva Backseat Driver. Backseat Driver is an AI extension for VS Code Copilot, giving the AI tools for using the Clojure REPL, as well as for structural editing.Bruce HaumanBruce Hauman is a prolific toolmaker and long-time contributor to the Clojure community, perhaps best known as the creator of Figwheel‚Äîthe build tool that introduced live code reloading and made real-time browser development a reality for ClojureScript developers. Bruce‚Äôs legendary 2014 ‚ÄúFlappy Bird‚Äù demo not only turned heads, but set a new standard for interactive coding, enabling developers to see their changes instantly and stay in the creative flow.\nBruce also built Devcards, a library for interactive documentation that brings a visual REPL experience to ClojureScript, and Rebel Readline, the feature-rich REPL for Clojure and ClojureScript, complete with syntax highlighting, code completion, and inline documentation.\nBruce‚Äôs latest project, Clojure MCP, tackles the next frontier: enabling AI assistants to work Clojure projects by connecting directly to live REPLs, providing real-time feedback and validation to improve the quality of AI-generated Clojure code.\nBeyond his tool building chops, Bruce is guided by a profound respect for users and a conviction that developer tooling should be radically better‚Äîsimple, powerful, and joyful to use. He‚Äôs also a fan of the outdoors: an avid canoe tripper, Appalachian Trail thru-hiker, and, currently, the hands-on renovator of a former church-turned-home in Saskatchewan.\nBuilding Dynamic Entity Extraction with BosquetAbstractEvery text processing application needs to answer a question: what is this text about? Named entity extraction is one part of the answer to this. It identifies and links words to real-world entities‚Äîturning \"Macroexpand 2025\" into structured data about a specific technology conference happening in a specific year.This extraction process involves multiple steps that can be implemented using LLMs. This presentation demonstrates how Bosquet, an LLM orchestration library, can help with building entity extraction pipelines.Speaker≈Ωygimantas MedelisAuthor of Bosquet, Clojure user since its v1.0. I have been working with unstructured text data processing for over a decade - hence the topic of the talk.\nCompiling Probabilistic Programs to Neural NetworksAbstractWe will take a look at how one can write a stochastic simulator for a simple business model, how embeddings and a graph neural network architecture for the compute graph of the simulator can be constructed, and how this neural network can be trained to provide fast inference over unknown variables of the simulator to guide the business process in real-time. We will then discuss the underlying methodology of probabilistic programming more systematically through the Daphne compiler, and how it provides different ways to compile a subset of Clojure simulator programs to neural network architectures, and as of lately also CUDA. The goal of this discussion is to provide understanding of both the methodology and applications of probabilistic programming, as well as to gather more feedback from the Clojure community to render Daphne not only an academic platform, but also more practical. One such potential practical integration we will discuss is with LLMs that can help with the simulator construction.SpeakerChristian WeilbachChristian Weilbach is a long-time Clojure developer working on distributed systems such as replikativ, Datahike, and supporting libraries. He has also worked with Clojure during his PhD on probabilistic programming, besides work on different simulators and inference systems in Julia, Python and C++.
