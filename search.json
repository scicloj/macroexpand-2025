Tomáš graduated in Mathematical Informatics from Masaryk University in 1996, and after decades in publishing, returned to coding in 2022—working almost exclusively in Clojure. His background bridges technical and literary worlds, allowing him to approach basket analysis from both perspectives: as a publisher seeking business insights and as a programmer exploring Scicloj's capabilities. In 2021, he co-founded Servantes, developing software for modern publishers worldwide. This presentation reflects his recent journey, having attended machine learning classes at his alma mater last year, and represents his practical experiments applying these concepts to his publishing business with Clojure tools.

Being a curious mind, she is always looking to broaden her horizons through learning about new things, travelling the world and plays badminton in her free time along with reading voraciously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBook Basket Analysis: A Beginner's Journey with Scicloj\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a newcomer to data science and Scicloj, I'll share my exploration of market basket analysis applied to publishing sales data. This case study demonstrates how even data science beginners can implement correlation analysis and the Apriori algorithm using Clojure tools. I'll walk through my learning process with Tablecloth for data manipulation and Kindly for visualizations, focusing on practical solutions rather than theoretical complexity. Join me to see how entry-level Scicloj implementations can transform customer order histories into meaningful cross-selling recommendations, proving that useful data insights are accessible without deep expertise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTomáš Baránek is a blend of publisher and programmer who brings a beginner's curiosity to data science with Clojure. As co-founder of Jan Melvil Publishing, he leads a small independent house that has released over 166 high-quality non-fiction titles since 2007, with average sales of 10,000 copies per book. Tomáš graduated in Mathematical Informatics from Masaryk University in 1996, and after decades in publishing, returned to coding in 2022—working almost exclusively in Clojure. His background bridges technical and literary worlds, allowing him to approach basket analysis from both perspectives: as a publisher seeking business insights and as a programmer exploring Scicloj's capabilities. In 2021, he co-founded Servantes, developing software for modern publishers worldwide. This presentation reflects his recent journey, having attended machine learning classes at his alma mater last year, and represents his practical experiments applying these concepts to his publishing business with Clojure tools.

She loves open source development, fostering communities online and in-person, and learning new things. When she's not at her desk, you can find Kira teaching yoga, playing violin, or running with her dog.Ray has decades of experience writing commercial software for databases, finance, manufacturing and cloud services. He is a Clojure enthusiast and advocate and produces and participates in several podcasts and YouTube channels. The impact of hyper-scaled LLMs is the subject of his most recent project. While not raging, he’s gardening, out on a bike or in the woods with a camera.Josh is a software engineer, engineering leader, podcast host, and union organiser hailing from Stockholm. A technology enthusiast from early in life, he has been becoming increasingly aware of the social impacts of technology. He advocates a Luddite perspective, where the worth of technologies is determined by whether they contribute to or detract from human thriving.Siavash is a Clojure developer with a knack for trying new things and crafting solutions through creative combinations of technology. He's worked on GIS software for agriculture, building a low-code BI tool powered by Clojure, LLMs, and rule engines to extract key reports for executives. These days, he's working on startcheck.xyz, an automatic pitch deck evaluation software.Siyoung Byun is currently a freelance fullstack Clojure developer living in Seoul, South Korea. She studied Astrophysics for her undergrad in Canada,  where she first got into programming and data analysis while running simulations of dying stars crashing into each other. Ever since she was introduced to Clojure at a previous employer in 2018, it quickly became her favorite programming language and her passion. \n Beyond software development and data analysis, she likes to hike, bike, knit, sew and snuggle with her cat in her free time.\n \nIn the field of AI, Python is the current reigning champ. But the Python ecosystem's dirty secret is that most of the libraries holding the system together are wrappers around C/C++ libraries that do most of the important work. Jank is the native Clojure dialect built on compiler technologies like LLVM, giving it access into the same native libraries powering the Python ecosystem. As Jank heads towards its first alpha release, its most highly anticipated feature, seamless C++ interop is already capable of wrapping and using native C++ libraries for machine learning and artificial intelligence. In this talk, we will show how to leverage Jank's C++ interop to wrap the most popular deep learning library in usage right now, libtorch, which most would have known through its Python frontend, PyTorch. As a proof of concept, we will display an implementation of GPT-2, the LLM released in 2019 using our Torch wrapper. This talk will give Clojure practitioners interested in using Clojure for ML/AI a glimpse into the future of how important C++ libraries can be utilized with Jank.Monty is an aspiring compiler engineer who enjoys Lisps and always wanted a reason to learn Clojure. He found an excellent reason with jank, the native Clojure dialect.Shantanu is a budding Clojure programmer and the newest member of the jank mentees team. With a background in mainstream languages like Kotlin and TypeScript, and a longstanding fascination with Clojure, compilers, and runtimes, he was naturally drawn to jank.Jianling is a software engineer with a focus on machine learning. He has always been intrigued by how compilers work. He has been hacking on jank, even though he had little experience with Clojure! The work of bringing torch to jank is right up his alley.\nWe will have a conversation with a few of the toolmakers behind Clojure's main AI assistants.Eric Dallo is a Emacs, NixOS fanatic, he loves programming, especially when focused on dev tooling, He maintains clojure-lsp, ECA, deps-bin, lsp-mode, and other related libraries, Eric works with Clojure at Nubank and currently is focused on AI pair programming mutli-editors with ECA.Peter Strömberg is a curious coder since 40+ years and is extra fascinated by making software that he uses do new things. These days he practically lives in VS Code and is making Clojure related extensions for it. Peter maintains Calva, Joyride, and Calva Backseat Driver. Backseat Driver is an AI extension for VS Code Copilot, giving the AI tools for using the Clojure REPL, as well as for structural editing.Bruce Hauman is a prolific toolmaker and long-time contributor to the Clojure community, perhaps best known as the creator of Figwheel—the build tool that introduced live code reloading and made real-time browser development a reality for ClojureScript developers. Bruce’s legendary 2014 “Flappy Bird” demo not only turned heads, but set a new standard for interactive coding, enabling developers to see their changes instantly and stay in the creative flow.\nBruce also built Devcards, a library for interactive documentation that brings a visual REPL experience to ClojureScript, and Rebel Readline, the feature-rich REPL for Clojure and ClojureScript, complete with syntax highlighting, code completion, and inline documentation.\nBruce’s latest project, Clojure MCP, tackles the next frontier: enabling AI assistants to work Clojure projects by connecting directly to live REPLs, providing real-time feedback and validation to improve the quality of AI-generated Clojure code.\nBeyond his tool building chops, Bruce is guided by a profound respect for users and a conviction that developer tooling should be radically better—simple, powerful, and joyful to use. He’s also a fan of the outdoors: an avid canoe tripper, Appalachian Trail thru-hiker, and, currently, the hands-on renovator of a former church-turned-home in Saskatchewan.\nEvery text processing application needs to answer a question: what is this text about? Named entity extraction is one part of the answer to this. It identifies and links words to real-world entities—turning \"Macroexpand 2025\" into structured data about a specific technology conference happening in a specific year.This extraction process involves multiple steps that can be implemented using LLMs. This presentation demonstrates how Bosquet, an LLM orchestration library, can help with building entity extraction pipelines.Author of Bosquet, Clojure user since its v1.0. I have been working with unstructured text data processing for over a decade - hence the topic of the talk.\nWe will take a look at how one can write a stochastic simulator for a simple business model, how embeddings and a graph neural network architecture for the compute graph of the simulator can be constructed, and how this neural network can be trained to provide fast inference over unknown variables of the simulator to guide the business process in real-time. We will then discuss the underlying methodology of probabilistic programming more systematically through the Daphne compiler, and how it provides different ways to compile a subset of Clojure simulator programs to neural network architectures, and as of lately also CUDA. The goal of this discussion is to provide understanding of both the methodology and applications of probabilistic programming, as well as to gather more feedback from the Clojure community to render Daphne not only an academic platform, but also more practical. One such potential practical integration we will discuss is with LLMs that can help with the simulator construction.Christian Weilbach is a long-time Clojure developer working on distributed systems such as replikativ, Datahike, and supporting libraries. He has also worked with Clojure during his PhD on probabilistic programming, besides work on different simulators and inference systems in Julia, Python and C++. He has published many machine learning & AI related papers in top tier venues and is working on an organizational framework of life & intelligence (both in theory and implementation).\n\n\nLearn more about Macroexpand 2025 and our speakers."

This case study demonstrates how even data science beginners can implement correlation analysis and the Apriori algorithm using Clojure tools. I'll walk through my learning process with Tablecloth for data manipulation and Kindly for visualizations, focusing on practical solutions rather than theoretical complexity. Join me to see how entry-level Scicloj implementations can transform customer order histories into meaningful cross-selling recommendations, proving that useful data insights are accessible without deep expertise.Tomáš Baránek is a blend of publisher and programmer who brings a beginner's curiosity to data science with Clojure. As co-founder of Jan Melvil Publishing, he leads a small independent house that has released over 166 high-quality non-fiction titles since 2007, with average sales of 10,000 copies per book.\nTomáš graduated in Mathematical Informatics from Masaryk University in 1996, and after decades in publishing, returned to coding in 2022—working almost exclusively in Clojure. His background bridges technical and literary worlds, allowing him to approach basket analysis from both perspectives: as a publisher seeking business insights and as a programmer exploring Scicloj's capabilities.\nIn 2021, he co-founded Servantes, developing software for modern publishers worldwide. This presentation reflects his recent journey, having attended machine learning classes at his alma mater last year, and represents his practical experiments applying these concepts to his publishing business with Clojure tools.\nHe lives in the Czech Republic, in city of Brno.\nDoes your heart beat like a clock? No. It turns out that your heart rate varies. How much it varies, that is the question.

Ever since she was introduced to Clojure at a previous employer in 2018, it quickly became her favorite programming language and her passion. \n Beyond software development and data analysis, she likes to hike, bike, knit, sew and snuggle with her cat in her free time.\n \nIn the field of AI, Python is the current reigning champ. But the Python ecosystem's dirty secret is that most of the libraries holding the system together are wrappers around C/C++ libraries that do most of the important work. Jank is the native Clojure dialect built on compiler technologies like LLVM, giving it access into the same native libraries powering the Python ecosystem. As Jank heads towards its first alpha release, its most highly anticipated feature, seamless C++ interop is already capable of wrapping and using native C++ libraries for machine learning and artificial intelligence. In this talk, we will show how to leverage Jank's C++ interop to wrap the most popular deep learning library in usage right now, libtorch, which most would have known through its Python frontend, PyTorch. As a proof of concept, we will display an implementation of GPT-2, the LLM released in 2019 using our Torch wrapper. This talk will give Clojure practitioners interested in using Clojure for ML/AI a glimpse into the future of how important C++ libraries can be utilized with Jank.Monty is an aspiring compiler engineer who enjoys Lisps and always wanted a reason to learn Clojure. He found an excellent reason with jank, the native Clojure dialect.Shantanu is a budding Clojure programmer and the newest member of the jank mentees team. With a background in mainstream languages like Kotlin and TypeScript, and a longstanding fascination with Clojure, compilers, and runtimes, he was naturally drawn to jank.Jianling is a software engineer with a focus on machine learning. He has always been intrigued by how compilers work. He has been hacking on jank, even though he had little experience with Clojure! The work of bringing torch to jank is right up his alley.\nWe will have a conversation with a few of the toolmakers behind Clojure's main AI assistants.Eric Dallo is a Emacs, NixOS fanatic, he loves programming, especially when focused on dev tooling, He maintains clojure-lsp, ECA, deps-bin, lsp-mode, and other related libraries, Eric works with Clojure at Nubank and currently is focused on AI pair programming mutli-editors with ECA.Peter Strömberg is a curious coder since 40+ years and is extra fascinated by making software that he uses do new things. These days he practically lives in VS Code and is making Clojure related extensions for it. Peter maintains Calva, Joyride, and Calva Backseat Driver. Backseat Driver is an AI extension for VS Code Copilot, giving the AI tools for using the Clojure REPL, as well as for structural editing.Bruce Hauman is a prolific toolmaker and long-time contributor to the Clojure community, perhaps best known as the creator of Figwheel—the build tool that introduced live code reloading and made real-time browser development a reality for ClojureScript developers. Bruce’s legendary 2014 “Flappy Bird” demo not only turned heads, but set a new standard for interactive coding, enabling developers to see their changes instantly and stay in the creative flow.\nBruce also built Devcards, a library for interactive documentation that brings a visual REPL experience to ClojureScript, and Rebel Readline, the feature-rich REPL for Clojure and ClojureScript, complete with syntax highlighting, code completion, and inline documentation.\nBruce’s latest project, Clojure MCP, tackles the next frontier: enabling AI assistants to work Clojure projects by connecting directly to live REPLs, providing real-time feedback and validation to improve the quality of AI-generated Clojure code.\nBeyond his tool building chops, Bruce is guided by a profound respect for users and a conviction that developer tooling should be radically better—simple, powerful, and joyful to use. He’s also a fan of the outdoors: an avid canoe tripper, Appalachian Trail thru-hiker, and, currently, the hands-on renovator of a former church-turned-home in Saskatchewan.\nEvery text processing application needs to answer a question: what is this text about? Named entity extraction is one part of the answer to this. It identifies and links words to real-world entities—turning \"Macroexpand 2025\" into structured data about a specific technology conference happening in a specific year.This extraction process involves multiple steps that can be implemented using LLMs. This presentation demonstrates how Bosquet, an LLM orchestration library, can help with building entity extraction pipelines.Author of Bosquet, Clojure user since its v1.0. I have been working with unstructured text data processing for over a decade - hence the topic of the talk.\nWe will take a look at how one can write a stochastic simulator for a simple business model, how embeddings and a graph neural network architecture for the compute graph of the simulator can be constructed, and how this neural network can be trained to provide fast inference over unknown variables of the simulator to guide the business process in real-time. We will then discuss the underlying methodology of probabilistic programming more systematically through the Daphne compiler, and how it provides different ways to compile a subset of Clojure simulator programs to neural network architectures, and as of lately also CUDA. The goal of this discussion is to provide understanding of both the methodology and applications of probabilistic programming, as well as to gather more feedback from the Clojure community to render Daphne not only an academic platform, but also more practical. One such potential practical integration we will discuss is with LLMs that can help with the simulator construction.Christian Weilbach is a long-time Clojure developer working on distributed systems such as replikativ, Datahike, and supporting libraries. He has also worked with Clojure during his PhD on probabilistic programming, besides work on different simulators and inference systems in Julia, Python and C++. He has published many machine learning & AI related papers in top tier venues and is working on an organizational framework of life & intelligence (both in theory and implementation).\n\n\nLearn more about Macroexpand 2025 and our speakers."

But the Python ecosystem's dirty secret is that most of the libraries holding the system together are wrappers around C/C++ libraries that do most of the important work. Jank is the native Clojure dialect built on compiler technologies like LLVM, giving it access into the same native libraries powering the Python ecosystem. As Jank heads towards its first alpha release, its most highly anticipated feature, seamless C++ interop is already capable of wrapping and using native C++ libraries for machine learning and artificial intelligence. In this talk, we will show how to leverage Jank's C++ interop to wrap the most popular deep learning library in usage right now, libtorch, which most would have known through its Python frontend, PyTorch. As a proof of concept, we will display an implementation of GPT-2, the LLM released in 2019 using our Torch wrapper. This talk will give Clojure practitioners interested in using Clojure for ML/AI a glimpse into the future of how important C++ libraries can be utilized with Jank.Monty is an aspiring compiler engineer who enjoys Lisps and always wanted a reason to learn Clojure. He found an excellent reason with jank, the native Clojure dialect.Shantanu is a budding Clojure programmer and the newest member of the jank mentees team. With a background in mainstream languages like Kotlin and TypeScript, and a longstanding fascination with Clojure, compilers, and runtimes, he was naturally drawn to jank.Jianling is a software engineer with a focus on machine learning. He has always been intrigued by how compilers work. He has been hacking on jank, even though he had little experience with Clojure! The work of bringing torch to jank is right up his alley.20:00ConclusionTBD\nDetecting your timezone...* Schedule is subject to change.

It has been built with AI assistance right from the beginning. Four months into the implementation, I have gained some experience with AI assisted coding, which I'd like to share in this talk.\nFirst I like to give an overview of QClojure to set the stage. I will show the tools and the workflow for AI assisted coding, including some prompts. Then we look at the actual process of working with the AI. Finally I will give you some of my best practices and summarize with the lessons learned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLudger Solbach is a software architect for 'msg for automotive' in Germany. He is the creator of Overarch, a lightweight system modeling and visualization tool and QClojure, a library for programming quantum computers. His favorite programming language by far is Clojure, a modern functional LISP. He uses it for his open source work, at work when feasible, and to create models for his 3D-Printer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding Dynamic Entity Extraction with Bosquet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery text processing application needs to answer a question: what is this text about? Named entity extraction is one part of the answer to this. It identifies and links words to real-world entities—turning \"Macroexpand 2025\" into structured data about a specific technology conference happening in a specific year.\nThis extraction process involves multiple steps that can be implemented using LLMs. This presentation demonstrates how Bosquet, an LLM orchestration library, can help with building entity extraction pipelines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor of Bosquet, Clojure user since its v1.0.

These days he practically lives in VS Code and is making Clojure related extensions for it. Peter maintains Calva, Joyride, and Calva Backseat Driver. Backseat Driver is an AI extension for VS Code Copilot, giving the AI tools for using the Clojure REPL, as well as for structural editing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBruce Hauman is a prolific toolmaker and long-time contributor to the Clojure community, perhaps best known as the creator of Figwheel—the build tool that introduced live code reloading and made real-time browser development a reality for ClojureScript developers. Bruce’s legendary 2014 “Flappy Bird” demo not only turned heads, but set a new standard for interactive coding, enabling developers to see their changes instantly and stay in the creative flow. Bruce also built Devcards, a library for interactive documentation that brings a visual REPL experience to ClojureScript, and Rebel Readline, the feature-rich REPL for Clojure and ClojureScript, complete with syntax highlighting, code completion, and inline documentation. Bruce’s latest project, Clojure MCP, tackles the next frontier: enabling AI assistants to work Clojure projects by connecting directly to live REPLs, providing real-time feedback and validation to improve the quality of AI-generated Clojure code. Beyond his tool building chops, Bruce is guided by a profound respect for users and a conviction that developer tooling should be radically better—simple, powerful, and joyful to use.
