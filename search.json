They will focus on two high-priority topics on our journey to make Clojure grow to new fields: Noj and AI.\nThese conferences are related and informed by the Macroexpand Gatherings series, that focuses on in-depth discussions around Clojure growth.\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to Submit a Talk Proposal!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline\nEvent Details\n\n\n\n\nOngoing\nProject idea discussions are not open\n\n\nSeptember 1, 2025\nFinal deadline for talk proposal submissions\n\n\nOctober 17-18, 2025\nMacroexpand-Noj Focus: Growing the Noj ecosystem\n\n\nOctober 24-25, 2025\nMacroexpand-Deep - The first Clojure AI conference\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease see the Speakers chapter for guidelines.\n\n\n\nThe kind of audience we have in mind is of general Clojure programmers.
